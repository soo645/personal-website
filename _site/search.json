However, cities in California face significant disparities in financial stability due to varying economic challenges and fiscal policies. This project seeks to address these disparities by analyzing key factors influencing fiscal health."

The analysis was supplemented with data visualizations, including histograms, scatter plots, and box plots, to illustrate trends and patterns clearly."

    "text": "Key Findings\nThe findings revealed that larger cities generally rank higher in fiscal health, though the correlation is weak. Unemployment rates showed no significant relationship with population size, but a few cities exhibited outliers with notably higher rates. Most importantly, fiscal health was strongly influenced by factors such as debt burden and pension funding rank, which were identified as the most critical predictors of financial stability."

While population size plays a role, deeper structural factors like debt management and pension funding have a more substantial impact. Cities with high fiscal health rankings typically have better financial governance and stability, whereas lower-ranked cities often struggle with structural weaknesses."

These include enhancing fiscal transparency, strengthening debt and pension management strategies, and implementing targeted support programs for cities with weaker financial stability. Policymakers should also consider including socio-economic and governance indicators in future assessments to capture a more comprehensive picture of fiscal health."

Initial analysis revealed significant challenges:\n\nSeveral variables, such as Shucked Weight, Weight, Age, and Height, exhibited right-skewed distributions, while Length and Diameter were left-skewed.\nExtreme outliers were identified, particularly in the Height variable (e.g., values ranging from 0.0375 to 2.8250 feet), suggesting potential data errors or mutations.\nMulticollinearity among explanatory variables was detected, as high correlations complicate the estimation of individual predictor effects."

    "text": "Interpretation\nThis model retained a high \\(R^2\\) of 97.12% and showed significant relationships for most predictors. It allowed for meaningful interpretations, such as a 1% increase in Weight being associated with a 1.09% increase in Shucked Weight. Similarly, a 1% increase in Age was linked to a 0.30% decrease in Shucked Weight, reflecting biological changes in older crabs. Male crabs were estimated to have 1.01% higher Shucked Weight than females, consistent with prior studies.\nDespite its strengths, the study faced limitations. Outliers in Height remained unresolved, and the predictors were limited to physical measurements and sex, excluding factors like diet or habitat. Future research could address these issues by incorporating additional variables and refining data collection processes to improve model accuracy and applicability."
